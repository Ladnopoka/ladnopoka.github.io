<h1 id="java-wordle-game">Java Wordle Game</h1>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px">
The Java Wordle Game is a terminal-based word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word in six attempts. After each guess, players receive hints in the form of numbers indicating if a letter is correct and in the right position, or if it exists elsewhere in the word. This project was developed in Java during my university studies and is supported by a word list of over 20,000 words.
<h3>

## Features
- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a list of over 20,000 words.
- **Hints System**: After each guess, hints are displayed using numbers:
  - **0**: The letter does not exist in the word.
  - **1**: The letter exists but is in the wrong position.
  - **2**: The letter is in the correct position.
- **Six Attempts**: Players have six attempts to guess the word correctly.
- **Helper Methods**: The game includes helper methods that filter out possible words based on previously guessed letters.

## How to Play
1. The game starts by selecting a random word from the word list.
2. The player has to guess the word by typing in a five-letter word.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback using a hint system:
    - **2**: The letter is correct and in the right position.
    - **1**: The letter exists but is in the wrong position.
    - **0**: The letter does not exist in the word.
4. Players have six attempts to guess the word correctly. If they fail, the correct word is revealed.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for development.
