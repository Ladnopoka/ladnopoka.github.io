# Overview
Dungeon Forge is a Godot 4 extension plugin that allows users to generate dungeon-like layouts in their scenes with a click of a button. This plugin opens a new window in the Godot 4 editor in the bottom right corner where users can select from three different biomes: dungeons, wooden cabins, and frozen caves. Upon selecting the gridmap generator in the menu, a new pop-up menu on the right allows users to set parameters for the dungeon layouts and then generate the layouts and meshes. Additional features include a first-person controller that allows users to explore generated dungeons, saving generated layouts, and reusing dungeons.

# Features
