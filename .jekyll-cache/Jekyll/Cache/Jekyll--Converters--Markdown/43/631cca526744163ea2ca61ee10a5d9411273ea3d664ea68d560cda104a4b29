<h1 id="java-wordle-game">Java Wordle Game</h1>
<p>The Java Wordle Game is a terminal-based word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word in six attempts. After each guess, players receive hints in the form of numbers indicating if a letter is correct and in the right position, or if it exists elsewhere in the word. This project was developed in Java during my university studies and is supported by a word list of over 20,000 words.</p>
