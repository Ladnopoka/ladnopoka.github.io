<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Dungeon Forge is a Godot 4 extension plugin that allows users to generate dungeon-like layouts in their scenes with a click of a button. This plugin opens a new window in the Godot 4 editor in the bottom right corner where users can select from three different biomes: dungeons, wooden cabins, and frozen caves. Upon selecting the gridmap generator in the menu, a new pop-up menu on the right allows users to set parameters for the dungeon layouts and then generate the layouts and meshes. Additional features include a first-person controller that allows users to explore generated dungeons, saving generated layouts, and reusing dungeons.</p>

<br />‘Yes, I do! ‘ exclaimed Jay.
<br />‘Alright, let’s take a break.’
<br />‘Yeah, let’s take some pictures of the view.’
<br />‘Great. But don’t make a bokeh again. It sucks.’
<br />‘I like ‘em. So buzz off.’
<br />‘Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz’.
<br />‘Peace. Won’t argue with you.’
<br />They made their way out of the room on the top floor of the mansion to the patio, Su started clicking pictures,
and Jay and Prad started smoking.
<br />Hills encompassed the village on all sides, and lightning struck them repeatedly. The sky was eerily dark, and the moon was now nowhere to be seen.
<br />‘This is odd’ remarked Goutham.
<br />The lightning wasn’t ordinary. There was too much of it, and the guys knew something wasn’t right.
Through the rain, on the other side of the village, they spotted something.
There was one little area on a hill where lightning struck almost periodically,
and after four or five cycles, about ten adjacent places up there would get hit by a wide line of almost blinding light.
Though they initially dismissed the idea, curiosity got the better of them, and they soon started making plans to get there.
<br />‘Okay, how?’
<br />‘The panther’ Prady said.
<br />‘Really, bruh?’
<br />‘We’ll get drenched to death.’
<br />‘Oh come on. The panther will always be our official adventure vehicle we all agreed.’
<br />The panther was an old topless 4x4 Jeep they had bought together. Rain couldn’t stop their insane quest for adventure.
<br />‘Panther it is, then. Let’s roll!’
<br />‘WE’RE GONNA DIE!’ Jay hollered.
<br />‘HAHAHAHA’
<br />They got in the panther, with their usual outfits: overcoats, hats, torchlights, backpacks and unrivalled bravado.
The panther easily made its way through the water into the jungle. They had already gotten drenched, but that wasn’t the priority on their minds.
It was the mysterious appearance of this supposed lightning.
<br />As the panther waded through the huge rocks and the dense trees and the puddles of water, they realised that they were so alone in the darkness.
Only the sounds of the vicious rain hitting the rocks could be heard, apart from the scary thuds from the thunders, and the continuous splashes of water off the panther’s tires.
Slowly ascending the hill, they looked back at the village which lied at the chief depression of the hills. Apart from that, there wasn’t any light, and darkness dominated the world.
<br />The strikes on the peak ahead got stronger and louder.
The panther couldn’t take them any farther as the forest grew denser. But the relentless crew got down and made their way to the destination, staying close to each other.
The wind grew stronger, and the rain drifted along its direction.
<br />‘This would make a perfect setup for a movie.’ Su was excited.
<br />‘Would it be tragic at the end too?’ Prad joked.
<br />‘Stop it guys, you’re scaring me!’ said Goutham.</p>
<h1 id="peak">Peak</h1>
<p>Just as they reached the peak, the biggest group of strikes hit close to them, and the shock carried by the impact grounded them.
As they gathered themselves up, what they saw baffled them. The lights in the village were gone. Hell, they couldn’t even make out if the village was still there.
<br />The sky was now more like outerspace, completely dark,only seen when lightning appeared.
<br />The rain had stopped, only god knew when. The ground beneath was already drying up, too freaking fast for them to believe.
As they still recovered from the shock, the most unexpected thing happened.
<br />Out of the blue, something lit up in the sky, and whooshed past the hills, making a shrill, unbearable sound.
<br />The light wasn’t white. It was blue.
They thought it was a comet, but this thing flew so freaking close to the hills. And what was that sound? Like an old lady’s whine.
<br />What in the world just happened?
<br />Whatever it was, and whatever just happened, they knew life wouldn’t be the same again. Their hearts began to race, and as shock receded, adrenaline took over.
<br />They looked at each other in unison.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jevgenij Ivanov</name></author><category term="other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game As incessant rains lashed out on the village, the game reached the final round. Tensions soared, concentration peaked and minds were doing a zillion calculations every second. All the roads were over a feet deep in water, and one could find the reflections of the midnight moon in the waters. Neither the loud rains nor the abrupt thunders could tamper with their game. They were in the zone. Playing the game. Phase locked. And after what seemed to be a very short time,the game ended. Jay finally won. ‘Woo Hoo !’ ‘Not again.’ said Su. ‘Don’t do your neigh. Please.’ said Prady. ‘Yee Haa !’ ‘There we go.’ said Goutham. ‘So you get your money back.’ said Su. ‘Yes, I do! ‘ exclaimed Jay. ‘Alright, let’s take a break.’ ‘Yeah, let’s take some pictures of the view.’ ‘Great.

There was no sound, no smell, no sight, no sense of  touch either. He felt weightless, spaceless. But behind him was something he didn’t want to see. He knew he had finally reached his ‘destiny’. And he was scared to see what the creator looked like.</p>

<p>He finally mustered the courage to turn. He turned.He turned, and experienced the ineffable. Before him was a figure, glowing in the dark.He realised this was outer space, and the figure stood on a one dimensional platform. Stood? No. It was moving violently, shaking all its parts. Now he could make out the shape. It resembled a human form. But gosh, it was atleast a million times bigger than him, and he could see the eyes too. The eyes were flaming red, lava pouring out from them. Its glow blinded him.Its hair flew all over the universe. And the whole universe started shaking with its moves, resonating with his steps. Was he dancing ? What was happening?</p>

<p>Accompanying the dance was noise he couldn’t bear. The sounds were absolutely disjoint glitches of varying kinds, too loud and shrill that he started bleeding and screaming. But he caught the rhythm soon and suddenly, they all appeared to be in perfect sync. The sound was surreal, the perfect embodiment of art. It was music.It was music at its purest form. He couldn’t believe what was happening. Since he knew he was in his mind, was it a virus? That was what pathogens looked like?
No. Was it a sub-atomic particle? Was it God ? Was it god? Was it god? It was god? That was god !</p>

<p>Suddenly he was transported with all kinds of emotions.He was scared and overwhelmed,he was laughing and crying,he was calm and angry and ecstatic; and joined the figure which continued to dance with fury, joy and vigor while the god music continued to blare. The music reached its crescendo now.He felt weightless, he felt invincible dancing and jumping like that.Tears stormed down from his eyes. He knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to ‘surrender’ himself to god. He wanted to die.Merge with god.Become a part of him. Is this what the vedas talked about? He was a rational person, but he couldn’t believe what was happening.</p>

<p>All his senses now worked in unison and gave him the unified sense. The one only attainable by god. He grew in space, and time. He was turning into god. He could see the space, the earth, its people, the zillion other planets thriving with life, which appeared so close to earth. He could see the beginning, he could see the end. He could see the beings, calling out to him. He could see the infinite and the infinitesimal. All through his mind.
<br />He turned into the Great Destroyer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jevgenij Ivanov</name></author><category term="other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[He was staring into absolute darkness.Nothing else, just plain void.

<p>Our mind is a constant source of new ideas and thoughts, which often end up garbled after we move on with time, and new
ideas and thoughts supersede these pieces of brilliance we once had.
Bookkeeping is essential to record one’s state of mind, and for retrospection. I remember the times when my mind was
bustling with fantastic theories, that I couldn’t keep track of them after a while. Most of them have become obscure with time;
I have forgotten all the specifics and the minute details. That is when I started blogging, to try and keep track of them
as well as to share these with people who might be fascinated by the same things as I am, which has also introduced me to
some amazing people.</p>

<h1 id="voice">Voice</h1>
<p>Talking of the interest in sharing things, I have developed a new interest in developing a strong voice over a lot of topics,
and sharing them. Voice is absolutely necessary for any person over anything. That’s how people develop perspective, and that’s
how they build character. However, just developing a voice could be detrimental, if it’s not shared and debated and questioned.
Sharing this voice out in the open with confidantes, or friends, or the public leads to debate and discussions and arguments, often fruitful.</p>

<h1 id="under-the-rug">Under the rug</h1>
<p>Moreover, I badly need to take time off consuming content and put it to good use analyzing and creating. The past few months have
been a true eye opener for me, and I was exposed to an array of critical topics like politics, human psychology, the big picture,
superstitions, and decisive observations on a lot of things that happen behind the scenes. This will be a place where I can analyze
what I’ve consumed, and develop a perspective. The interest has also extended to influence others.</p>

<h1 id="this-is-good-right">This is good, right?</h1>
<p>If everything else is a delusion, this is atleast a good way to spend time. This will also aid me in refining my vocab and communication style. I’ve always wanted to learn and master critical writing, and writing in general. And lastly, this will also make me tinker more with github and Jekyll and NodeJs and a plethora of the other options out there on the web.</p>

<h1 id="box-of-chocolates">Box of chocolates</h1>
<p>This is going to be awesome! I’m gonna write fiction, non-fiction, some songs maybe, and what not. Just that I’ll take more time
developing and refining the articles, to make it a notch better than <a href="http://tlojarus.blogspot.in/">TLOj</a>.<br />
Here’s to a bright future filled with hope and better conscience!</p>]]></content><author><name>Jevgenij Ivanov</name></author><category term="other" /><category term="Discourse" /><category term="NonFiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like I’m doing this.
